slush-oxygene
==============

> A [slush](http://slushjs.github.io) generator for AngularJS with Modules Scaffolding for scalable apps created for my company : [Oxygene Interactive](http://www.oxygene-interactive.com/).
> [Slush Oxygene](https://github.com/Argetloum/slush-oxygene) is also a fork of the great Slush package : [slush-angular](https://github.com/slushjs/slush-angular)

## Installation

Install `slush-oxygene` globally:

```bash
npm install -g slush-oxygene
```

Remember to install `slush` globally as well, if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install -g slush
```

## Usage

Create a new folder for your project:

```bash
mkdir my-angular-app
```

Run the generator from within the new folder:

```bash
cd my-angular-app

slush oxygene
```

You will now be prompted to give your new AngularJS app a name, which will be dasherized and used in its `bower.json` and `package.json` respectively. The chosen name will be camelized and used as the main angular module as well, inside `src/app/app.js`.

### CSS Preprocessor

You can choose between `LESS`, `Stylus`, and `Sass` to use as the CSS Preprocessor for your project.
The preprocessor scaffolding is inspired by Todd Motto [fireshell](https://github.com/toddmotto/fireshell)

### Project structure

The project structure with the Acme Module example included will look like this:

```

├── .editorconfig
├── .gitignore
├── .jshintrc

        │       ├── views                 # The partial views path
        │       └── AcmeModule.js/coffee  # The Acme module
        └── styles
            ├── modules                   # The breakpoints, typo, variables..
            ├── partials                  # The partial views stylesheets path
            ├── vendor                    # The vendor path
            └── app.styl/less/scss        # Main app stylesheet
```

### Gulpfile

#### Development

To start developing in your new generated project run:

```bash
gulp serve
```

Then head to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

The `serve` tasks starts a static file server, which serves your AngularJS application, and a watch task which watches your files for changes and lints, builds and injects them into your index.html accordingly.

#### Tests

To run tests run:

```bash
gulp test
```

#### Production ready build - a.k.a. dist

To make the app ready for deploy to production run:

```bash
gulp dist
```

Now you have a `./dist` folder with all your scripts and stylesheets concatenated and minified, also third party libraries installed with bower will be concatenated and minified into `vendors.min.js` and `vendors.min.css` respectively.
